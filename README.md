# STEM-salary-compensation-Analysis

**Data Source and Analysis Method:**

“Data Science and STEM Salaries- 62,000+ STEM salaries scraped from levels.fyi” from Kaggle is the dataset we will research on. Levels.fyi is a website for any anonymous to report their salary and could be used to compare career levels and compensation packages across different companies. This dataset includes 29 attributes and 62,000 records dated ranging from 7th Jun 2017, to 17th Aug 2021. Key attributes including company name, company level, title, location, total yearly compensation, race, education level etc.

First, we will start with exploratory data analysis to have some general idea about the dataset. Second, clustering is one of the analysis methods we plan to use to find key drivers of salary. Regression is also considered to be used since we have chronological data. Third, we might want to segment the data by our interests no matter by company, race, education level or location for in- depth comparison.
